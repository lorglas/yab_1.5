BUGS

yab is not totally bug free. Some bugs are well-known (see list below). 

Please report bugs that crashes yab itself. Note: An error message by 
yab is probably a bug in your program and not a bug in yab! 

When reporting bugs, please provide a small yab program demonstrating 
the bug, so we can fix it ASAP.

Known issues in yab 1.5:
- textedit add does not harmonize with undo 
- checkbox/button image might have a small memory leak
- on exit yab might hang up when run in a terminal and TOOLTIP is used
  (this is a race condition issue with the BubbleHelper class on R5 and 
  maybe Haiku)
- dropbox might be screwed up on Haiku
